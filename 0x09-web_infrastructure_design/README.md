# Web infrastructure design

With this project we had the first approach to web infrastructures, in which the components, their purpose and funtionalities were studied. Topics related to servers, DNS, load balancers, clusters, network basics, security, protocols got studied to develop infrastructures and distingish their benefits and downsides. In each file of the repository their is a link to a imgur account with the diagrams.  In the next table can be found the files link and the diagram it represents.
